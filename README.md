# Node.js Server Practice CI/CD

This is a simple Node.js server that is used to practice CI/CD and trunk based development with automatic release creation and deployment of docker image to a registry.

## CI/CD

Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment is a practice that allows developers to automate the process of building, testing, and deploying code. This is done through the use of tools and services that allow for the automation of these processes.

## Trunk Based Development

Trunk Based Development is a practice that involves the use of a single branch for development. This is in contrast to other branching strategies such as Gitflow, where multiple branches are used for development, testing, and deployment.

## Benefits of CI/CD and Trunk Based Development

* Faster development and deployment of code
* More frequent releases $$$
* Fixing bugs and issues at the speed of thought
* Automated testing and Deployment
* Easier to manage and maintain code
* Easier to collaborate with other developers

## Tools used to accomplish this
